How To Play:

Press the arrow keys to move.
Press 'z' to shoot a bullet.
You need to first activate all the enemy cannons (the rectangles with green lights) by shooting them and then fly to the target point (the red flag).
Once a cannon is activated, it will shoot bullets toward you. Try to dodge the bullets from enemies!
There are also some spikes in the map, you need to dodge them too.
If you are hit by enemies' bullets or touch a spike, the level will be reset.
